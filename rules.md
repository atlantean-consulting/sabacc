# Sabacc con i Tarocchi

Sabacc is a card game which originated "a long time ago in a galaxy
far, far away". There are many variations of the game in the Star Wars
universe. This is another variation of the game which can actually be
played in *our* universe.

In Star Wars canon, a typical Sabacc deck comprises 76 cards (four
suits of 15 cards each plus 16 special cards). In our universe, a
Tarot deck comprises 78 cards (four suits of 14 cards each plus 22
Major Arcana). It's obvious where George Lucas got the idea. George
Lucas ripped off a lot of ideas. The Walt Disney Corporation has
ripped off way more ideas, way more shamelessly; so to say George
Lucas or Disney have some so-called "copyright" over the conceptual
rules of a card game is fucking idiotic. We're going to play Sabacc
with a Tarot deck, and it's gonna be pure gold.

The tarot, first known as *trionfi* and later as *tarocchi* or
*tarock*, is a pack of playing cards which originated in Italy in the
mid-15th century CE. Tarot decks have traditionally been used in
various parts of Europe to play games such as Italian *tarocchini*,
French *tarot* and Austrian *Königrufen*, many of which are still
played today. In the late 18th century, some tarot decks began to be
used for a form of divination called "cartomancy", which has led to
many custom decks being developed for such this purpose. In
English-speaking countries, these kind of decks are the only ones most
people know of, so you'll definitely raise some eyebrows when you
suggest playing a card game with a Tarot deck. Is this a problem? Hell
no. Don't worry about it.

Like the common playing cards, tarot has four suits which vary by
region: French suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) in Northern
Europe, Latin suits (Cups, Coins, Clubs, Swords) in Southern Europe,
and German suits (Hearts, Bells, Acorns, Leaves) in Central Europe.
Each suit has 14 cards: ten pip cards numbering from one (or Ace) to
ten, and four face cards (King, Queen, Knight, and Jack/Knave/Page).
In addition, the tarot has an extra suit of 21 numbered cards called *trionfi* and a single card known as the Fool; this 22-card section of
the deck is known as the "major arcana". (It also shares a name with a
certain very-wonderful-U.S.-President-who-shall-not-be-named, but you
should probably not call the suit by that name in polite company
unless you'd prefer to fight someone rather than play Sabacc; I'd
personally prefer to play Sabacc. Let's play some fuckin' Sabacc.)
These tarot cards are still used throughout much of Europe to play
conventional card games without occult associations.

You probably should use a Marseille style deck for this game, not one
of the decks intended for divination like the Rider-Waite-Smith. When
considering the propriety of a given deck, a good rule of thumb is: If
the suit cards have elaborate imagery, the deck is probably intended
for divination, but depending on the artwork, it might be cool to play
games with them. (I'll bet there's even a Star Wars Tarot!) However: a
deck which is used for card games should *never* be used for
divination and vice versa, for the simple, practical reason that a
divination deck should never be handled by someone other than its
owner.

If you're trying to explain what Sabacc is, feel free to borrow my "elevator pitch":

"Sabacc is a card game with Texas Hold 'Em-style betting, Rummy-style card drawing, and Blackjack-style scoring."

## How to Play

Sabacc is usually played in groups of three to six. The object of the
game is to win lots of money and/or other valuables (for example, a
spaceship) by wagering on and winning a series of hands of cards,
according to the following rules.

Each *game* consists of several *hands*, which each involve several
*rounds* or *turns *of betting. Each player's objective during each
hand is to form a set of cards with a point total closest to an
absolute value of 23 (*i.e.*, +23 or -23), without going over.

The suit cards are ranked, from highest to lowest: Ace (15), King
(14), Queen (13), Knight (12), Jack/Page (11), 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4,
3, 2, Ace (1). You will note that Aces can be high or low. Suits
themselves are not ranked, so hands that differ by suit alone are of
equal value. If multiple players have hands of equal value, house rules determine what happens. The players can either:

1. Split the pot equally; or
2. Apply tiebreaker rules, which go as follows:
a) Whichever player's high card is higher wins the hand; b) If all players have the same high card, the suits rank in this order: *Trionfi*, Clubs/Wands, Cups,    Swords, and Coins/Disks.

Certain exceptions apply if a player "goes all-in" (more on that later).

The 22 *Trionfi* or "Major Arcana" are special cards which either have
negative point values or cause some special effect. We'll get to those
shortly.

In casual play, the right to deal a hand typically rotates clockwise
among the players and is marked by a token called a *dealer button*
(or *sa-buck* \[get it? *get it*??!!\]). If the game were to be played
in a space casino, a house dealer would handle the cards for each
hand, but the button would still rotate clockwise among the players to
indicate a nominal dealer, which determines the order of betting.

There are also two *blind buttons* which also rotate among the
players. The players holding the blind buttons at the beginning of
each hand must post a forced bet, which is also called a "blind". The
"big blind" is equal to the minimum bet (set by the house or by
consensus of the players) and the "small blind" is half of the big
blind.

Once the dealer for the first hand has been established, the dealer
places the Big Blind Button in front of the player to their left and
the Small Blind Button in front of the player to the left of the Big
Blind.

The dealer then shuffles the cards, the player to the dealer's right
cuts the pack, and the dealer deals two cards, one at a time,
clockwise around the table, to each player.

The dealer then deals one card face up to the discard pile, followed by three community cards face up to the center of the table, and then places the remaining pack face down next to the discard pile. This is called "the flop".

Play then passes to P1 on the dealer's left. P1 can choose to *play*
or *fold*. If P1 elects to fold, P1 gives their cards to the dealer,
face down, and takes no further action in the hand. (**N.B.** Folded
cards go into the "banished" or "removed from the hand" pile.) If P1
elects to play, P1 takes their first turn. Each player's turn follows
the same pattern:

1\. P must first *ante up* by matching the current bet.

2\. P can then *draw* either : 1 card from the draw pile

OR : A card from the discard pile *and any cards above it*

OR : A community card, replacing it with a card from their hand.

3\. P can then *discard* one card, face up, if they so choose.

4\. P then *knocks* or otherwise signals to the next player that they
have ended their turn. Play then passes to P2, the player on P1's
left.

Players can *raise the stakes* or *play special cards* at any time
during their turn.

On the first round of the hand, P1 has the big blind and therefore
doesn't have to ante up again in order to play. However, if another
player or players subsequently raise the stakes, every other player
must immediately *call* the bet or *fold.* A player can also call and
raise further.

Once the first round is finished, the dealer deals another card face up to the discard pile, followed by one community card to the center of the table. This is called "the turn". Play then passes to P1, who can elect either to *knock* (ending
their turn without doing anything) or *play* by making a non-zero bet.
The second round then proceeds in the same way as the first round.

Once the second round is finished, the dealer deals another card face up to the discard pile, followed by a fifth community card to the center of the table. This is called "the river". Play then passes to P1, who can again elect either to *knock* or *play*. The third round then proceeds in the same way as the first two
rounds.

At the end of the third round, all remaining players reveal their
hands in a *showdown*, beginning with P1 to the dealer's left and
proceeding clockwise. The player whose hand has an absolute value
closest to 23 without going over wins the pot. The dealer and blind
players all pass their tokens to the person on their left, and a new
hand begins.

The values of the suit cards are noted above. The values and special
effects of the *trionfi* are shown in the following table.

## The *Trionfi*

Number / Name                  | Value / Effect                 |
|--------------------|--------------------|
|0 -- The Fool                  | 0 points                       |
|I -- The Magician              | “Alter the Future”: Take the top 4 cards from the draw pile, look at them, arrange them to your liking, and replace them on the top of the draw pile.  The Magician card is then removed from the hand. |
|II -- The High Priestess       | -2 points                      |
|III -- The Empress             | -3 points                      |
|IV -- The Emperor              | A player of your choice must either ante up an additional big blind, immediately discard 2 cards, or fold.  The Emperor card is then removed from the hand.
|V -- The Hierophant            | Everyone must either confess the current value of their hand or instantly fold.  The Hierophant card is then removed from the hand.
|VI -- The Lovers               | +6 or -6 points, your choice.  |
|VII -- The Chariot             | Everyone must either discard 1 card or instantly fold.  The Chariot card is then removed from the hand.
|VIII -- Strength (Justice[^1]) | -8 points                      |
|IX -- The Hermit               | Place the Hermit card face up in front of you.  You take no further action in the hand and automatically advance to the showdown without having to bet again. You are also immune from any special effects during this time.
|X -- Wheel of Fortune          | Draw 4 cards, keep what you want, and discard the rest.  The Wheel of Fortune card is then removed from the hand.
|XI -- Justice (Strength)       | -11 points                     |
|XII -- The Hanged Man          | Can be played at any time during the hand, even if it is not your turn.  The Hanged Man is a “NOPE” card which immediately nullifies the effect of whatever card preceded it (*e.g.* The Magician).  The card is then removed from the hand, along with the card it nullified.
|XIII -- Death                  | -13 points                     |
|XIV -- Temperance              | -14 points                     |
|XV -- The Devil                | -15 points. If you have the Devil card in your hand at the beginning of your turn, you can give it to someone else.|
|XVI -- The Tower               | -16 points                     |
|XVII -- The Star               | -17 points                     |
|XVIII -- The Moon              |Give the Moon card to the dealer, who immediately deals another community card and removes the Moon card from the hand.
|XIX -- The Sun                 |Place the Sun card face up in front of you.  Everyone must play with their hands face up for the remainder of the hand.
|XX -- The Last Judgment        | Immediately ends the hand and advances everyone to the showdown who has not already folded.
|XXI -- The Universe            |“See the Future”: Take the top 6 cards from the draw pile, look at them, and replace them in the same order without showing them to anyone else.  The Universe card is then removed from the hand.

**N.B.** Removing a card from the hand is different than discarding
it. When a card is removed from the hand, it is gone and cannot be
used again until the next hand.

## Pure Sabacc & The Idiot

If a player finishes a hand with a score of exactly 23, they have a
"Pure Sabacc". The only hand which can beat a Pure Sabacc is called
"The Idiot", which consists of three cards: The Fool (0) and a 2 and 3
of the same suit.

## "All In"

If a player doesn't have enough chips to call a bet, they have two options:

1. Go "All In" and bet everything they have left; or

2. Stake something else of value besides chips (like a spaceship). The other players must unanimously agree to accept the stake. In a space casino, the house would never allow a player to do this (they'd prefer the player *pawn* their valuables to the house in exchange for more chips). In casual play (say, in a smugglers' hideout), it would generally be considered bad form to let a player stake something critical to their livelihood: for example, a spaceship, unless the player owned multiple ships; or a blaster pistol, if that was the only weapon the player owned. Acceptable stakes are things like a gold chain with fancy space gems, or perhaps *one of* the player's guns. However, given that Sabacc is a favorite game of scoundrels, depending on how greedy one's opponents are, they certainly might allow someone to stake a spaceship. After all, this is how Han Solo came to be the owner of the *Millennium Falcon*.

A player who is "all in" doesn't have to call subsequent bets from other players (since they *can't*), but because of this, they can't *win* any of that money either. If a player goes "all in", the value of the pot is frozen for the rest of the hand; any subsequent bets from other players go into a "side pot". If the "all in" player wins the hand, they only receive the value of the main pot; anything in the side pot gets split equally among the players who put money into it.

If a player goes "all in", and a second player subsequently goes "all in", another side pot gets created and the same rules apply with respect to the second "all in" player.

If a player decides to stake something else of value (like a spaceship), they still don't have to call subsequent bets, but no side pot gets created.
